An alternative [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql][EmacsSQL]] back-end for [[https://sqlite.org][SQLite]], which uses an Emacs
module that exposes parts of the SQLite C API to elisp, instead of
using subprocess as ~emacsql-sqlite~ does.  The module is provided
by the [[https://github.com/pekingduck/emacs-sqlite3-api][sqlite3]] package.

The goal is to provide a more performant and resilient drop-in
replacement for ~emacsql-sqlite~.  Taking full advantage of the
granular module functions currently isn't a goal.
