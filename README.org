This repository contains two libraries implementing [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql][EmacsSQL]] backends
for [[https://sqlite.org][SQLite]].  They are distributed as two separate packages on Melpa.

- ~emacsql-sqlite-builtin~ uses builtin support for SQLite, which was
  added in Emacs 29.

- ~emacsql-sqlite-module~ uses an Emacs module for SQLite, which is
  provided by the [[https://github.com/pekingduck/emacs-sqlite3-api][sqlite3]] package.
