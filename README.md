An alternative [EmacsSQL] back-end for [SQLite], which uses an Emacs
module that exposes parts of the SQLite C API to elisp, instead of
using subprocess as `emacsql-sqlite` does.  The module is provided
by the [`sqlite3`] package.

The goal is to provide a more performant and resilent drop-in
replacement for `emacsql-sqlite`.  Taking full advantage of the
granular module functions currently isn't a goal.
